" when vimrc source fails on some wonky updates:
" source ~/.dotfiles/ideavim_temporary_source.vim
source ~/.vimrc

" try to replicate the unsupported commands here:
nnoremap g; :action JumpToLastChange<Enter>
nnoremap g, :action JumpToNextChange<Enter>
nnoremap <Space> :action JumpToLastChange<Enter>
nnoremap <S-Space> :action JumpToNextChange<Enter>
" note that doing :action GotoNextBookmark<Enter> in IntelliJ won't set the automatic mark ` where you're jumping from,
" so you can't do `` to go back after doing ]` like you can in vim, if you just did GoTo... 
" and that m` in normal mode won't override the automatic ` -- but the ex-command `:mark <>` can.
nnoremap ]` :mark` \| :action GotoNextBookmark<Enter>
nnoremap [` :mark` \| :action GotoPreviousBookmark<Enter>
nnoremap <C-w>T :action Unsplit<Enter>

" regarding abbreviataion, convert indents
" abbreviations are not yet supported by ideaVim.
" cnoreabbrev retab! action ConvertIndentsToTabs
" cnoreabbrev retab action ConvertIndentsToSpaces
" for some reason ! in ex-command mode is not recognized by ideavim
" cnoremap ret! action ConvertIndentsToTabs
" but hey! that's all right. once you set the default indentation to using tabs for Java in IntelliJ,
" doing command option L to reformat will automatically convert all space indents to tab indents.
