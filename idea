# fix the intellij's auto-generated script's bug
# 1. doing "idea ." would sometimes open "/" root directory
# 2. doing relative path would open an empty file with the provided folder name
# problem: doesn't work when the path to pwd contains special characters (such as space or &) in the folder names.
# adding $(pwd) in front solves it by automatically escaping the special characters in the path - functionality provided by $(pwd) command substitution
